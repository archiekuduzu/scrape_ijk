# scrape_ijk
i could make the no image version the main version and then i could
have the image functionality as a seperate script running on the pickles
the advantage of this is we can scrape data quickly without downloading extra
stuff we dont need. more control is good.

# make the output less crazy
# make the ouptut readable
# make a log file that is seperate to the output in console
# make the functions easier to use so you can write a variety of scripts
# you dumbass fuck!
